abstract = "MicroStructPy is a statistical microstructure mesh generator written in Python. This software package includes classes and methods to generate a mesh by (i) creating a list of grain seed geometries, (ii) packing them into a domain, (iii) performing a Laguerre tessellation of the seed geometries, and (iv) performing quality unstructured meshing. Results can be visualized and compared with the specified microstructural properties. MicroStructPy accurately reproduces 2D and 3D polycrystalline microstructures with arbitrary number of phases, volume fractions and distributions, each including the possibility of elongated grains. It can also generate meshes for amorphous phases and porous materials. Meshes are suitable for direct numerical simulation, a prevalent technique in computational mechanics of materials and geomechanics. The package contains extensive documentation, including guides and demonstrations to facilitate adoption for new users."
